# Capstone Projects Repository

**Welcome to my Capstone Projects repository! Here, I'll be sharing and documenting my capstone projects, showcasing the culmination of my skills and knowledge.**

## Projects

### Project 1: [Jelly_Fish_Classification](https://github.com/alekha1234/My_Capstone_Projects/blob/main/CNN/Jelly_Fish.ipynb)
   - Jellyfish Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a project aimed at developing a machine learning model to accurately identify and classify different species of jellyfish from images. The project addresses the need for automated identification of jellyfish species, which is crucial for marine biologists and researchers studying marine ecosystems.
   - Python ,TensorFlow and Keras ,Image Processing Libraries ,Matplotlib and Seaborn ,GitHub etc.

### Project 2: [Cifar_10](https://github.com/alekha1234/My_Capstone_Projects/blob/main/CNN/Cifar_10.ipynb)
   - The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision and machine learning. It was created by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is split into two subsets: a training set containing 50,000 images and a test set with 10,000 images.
   - Numpy , Pandas , Matplotlib ,seaborn , tensorflow , keras .
